As we conclude Epoch 3 and transition into a new chapter for DistrictOne (D1), we are excited to announce several key changes that will drive our growth and community engagement in the Post-Gold Era:

- **Introduction of New Epochs with OLE Rewards:**\
With the conclusion of Epoch 3 today, new epochs will commence immediately. Starting from Epoch 4, we will introduce OLE airdrops every two weeks. The details of the OLE airdrop and the vesting model will be announced on the 4th of July. These airdrops will continue to be based on the current gems system, ensuring fairness and consistency, but we will also consider other factors to recognize active contributions from our community. We are actively working on optimizing the system, and you can expect significant improvements in Epoch 5.

- **Vesting Model for OLE:**\
Collected OLE, including regular OLE airdrops and collected OLE from previous epochs, will begin vesting from the 4th of July, following a vesting model designed to benefit long-term users. This model will provide stability and encourage sustained participation, aligning with our goal of fostering a loyal and engaged community. By rewarding long-term commitment, we aim to build a strong foundation for the future of D1.

- **Roadmap for D1 Native Token**\
One of the most exciting developments in our roadmap is the introduction of the D1 native token. This token will play a crucial role in our tokenomics structure, supporting our long-term vision and enabling further growth and innovation. When the D1 token goes live, we will conduct a D1 airdrop to reward our long-term users, as well as projects and community members who have contributed to building the D1 product and ecosystem.

We are confident that these new initiatives will strengthen our community and drive our mission forward. Our commitment to transparency, innovation, and user-centric development remains unwavering.

As a responsible and resilient team that has been building in the crypto space for the last four years, we are dedicated to building a better future for the crypto space. Trusted by leading investors such as Binance Labs, Crypto.com Cap, KuCoin, and DWF Labs, we have navigated the highs and lows with steadfast commitment to our vision. As we enter this new era, we invite you to join us in building a vibrant, inclusive, and thriving ecosystem.

Stay tuned for more updates and join us as we embark on this new chapter in the D1 story.

**Thank you for being a part of DistrictOne.**
