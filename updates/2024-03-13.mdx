## Key Updates

### Rollout of Sentinel
We're proud to announce the rollout of Sentinel, a game-changing collaborative content quality control solution that empowers shareholders to protect our spaces and ensure quality interactions. Stake your gems for speaking rights and help safeguard the integrity of discussions within our community.
### Anti-Bots Human Verification
To further secure our platform, we've implemented additional human verification steps. These measures are critical for actions like buying shares, rally participation, and claiming ole airdrops, ensuring authenticity in every transaction.
### Reward Recalibration
In our commitment to fairness, we've conducted thorough Sybil detection, leading to the ban or reset of gems for about 4000 accounts. This recalibration ensures that our rewards system is accurate and equitable. Affected users will have access to an appeal form.
### Blast Gold Distribution
Stay engaged and return to the D1 app from Monday 25 Mar to claim your Blast Gold rewards. These rewards are a testament to your active engagement, based on the total Gems you've earned.
### Rally Redesigned
We've reenvisioned rallies with an entry fee of 100 gems and a 400-gem contribution to the jackpot by each participant. Rally rewards now offer sOLE and shareholder boosts, potentially increasing rewards up to 6x. With rallies every two hours and a cap of three participations per day, we're balancing excitement with fair chances for all.
### Gems Gifts and Airdrops from Hosts
Community-building takes a new form with our innovative feature for hosts to gift Gems or initiate airdrops. Every day, hosts can distribute Gems as rewards to active community members as gifts or airdrops, based on the prior day's engagement metrics. This new system not only incentivizes daily interaction but also provides hosts with a direct way to acknowledge and reward their most engaged members, fostering a thriving and supportive community ecosystem.
### Boost Up for sOLE and Shareholders
The reward structure for sOLE and shareholders has been significantly enhanced. sOLE earnings have been escalated from 100% to 300%, tripling the potential rewards. Shareholder boosts have seen an increase from 200% to 300%, offering a substantial incentive for continued investment and engagement in community spaces. These boosts are designed to reward our most dedicated users and to encourage a deeper level of participation and contribution to the platform.
### Removal of Gems for Likes
While likes are a form of appreciation, they have become a medium for spam and like farming, detracting from content quality. This feature will be discontinued.
### Active Participation Requirement for Hosts
To claim daily gems from their spaces, hosts and cohosts must actively participate in the community.
