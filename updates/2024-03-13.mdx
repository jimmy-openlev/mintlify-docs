## Goal
We re-emphasize D1's mission is to create a web3 social space that is:
- **Open:** Ensuring open access where everyone can join any space and speak anytime. The aim is for most spaces to be inclusive to all, not just token holders.
- **Rewarding:** Participants earn while engaging and contributing positively, ensuring fairness in reward distribution.
- **Fun:** Engaging users through airdrops, competitions, and gifting.
- **Effective:** Minimizing management overhead using Sentinel for autonomous space management.
- **Connection:** Fostering strong bonds between hosts and their communities.

## Problem Statement
The platform faces challenges with:
- **Spamming**
- **Bots**
- **Fair Rewards:** The prevalence of spam, like farming, and bot activities dilutes the quality of contributions, necessitating a solution before proceeding with reward distribution.

## Key Updates
- **Removal of Gems for Likes:** While likes are a form of appreciation, they have become a medium for spam and like farming, detracting from content quality. This feature will be discontinued.
- **Introduction of Power Likes and Gifts:** This allows members to express appreciation with financial weight, encouraging quality engagement. This is coming next week.
- **Host-Controlled Gifts and Airdrops:** A portion of the previous day's generated gems will be available for hosts to gift to members or initiate space-wide lucky gem drops.
- **Increased Rally Frequency:** Rallies will now occur every 2 hours, with participation limits to balance engagement - non-sOLE holders can participate twice a day, sOLE holders four times a day with a 100% boost, and shareholders continue to enjoy a 200% boost in their spaces.
- **Active Participation Requirement for Hosts and Shareholders:** To claim daily gems from their spaces, hosts and shareholders must actively participate in the community.
- **Sentinel Integration:** A decentralized solution for self-managing spaces effectively.
- **Adjustment of Gems Earning:** To filter out spam, like farming, and bots generated volume, existing gem earnings will be recalibrated for fairness.
- **Human Verification for Financial Actions:** Necessary for buying shares, participating in rallies, and claiming airdrops to ensure authenticity.
- **Sybil Detection Measures:** Accounts engaging in prohibited activities will have their gems cleared, employing Source of Funds Tracing and Behavioral Clustering for enforcement.

## Reward Distribution Schedule Change
D1 embarks on an experimental journey to intertwine social interaction with financial incentives. While we've achieved remarkable user engagement, certain aspects require optimization:
- **$OLE Airdrop:** $OLE D1 Airdrop will be scheduled in May, and $OLE bi-weekly airdrop will begin in May, aligning with the Blast Airdrop.
- **Redistributing [Blast Gold](https://docs.blast.io/airdrop/developers#blast-gold) with Blast Points API:** Facilitates the redistribution of Blast Gold every 2-3 weeks, enabling D1 users to view their allocations on blast.io.

Prior to May, users can accumulate gems, receiving Blast Gold, and anticipate the $OLE and Blast airdrop in May based on their gem earnings.

## Building Bonds Between Hosts and Community
<img style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} src="/images/13-mar-hero.png" alt="New Reward Cycle"/>
In our new framework, the vitality of our ecosystem is directly tied to the activity levels of both hosts and community members. The structure is designed to not only enhance the bond between hosts and their communities but also to significantly increase the generation of gems, creating a more vibrant and rewarding environment for all participants.

- **Active Host Engagement:** Hosts will be able to distribute a percentage of the gems generated from the previous day as gifts to members. The more frequently hosts interact with their communities and distribute rewards, the greater the daily gem generation for the community and the hosts themselves. This encourages hosts to be actively involved, offering valuable content, organizing engaging activities, and recognizing member contributions.
- **Member Participation:** Similarly, members are incentivized to actively rally and participate in community events. Their engagement directly contributes to the gem pool, creating a cycle of positive reinforcement where active participation leads to more rewards.

- **Suggested Engagement Activities:**
  - **Daily Tasks:** Hosts can set specific tasks for members to complete, fostering interaction and contribution within the space.
  - **Alpha Sharing Sessions:** Hosts can organize exclusive insight and discussion sessions, adding value and deepening the connection with the community.

This iterative cycle of active host engagement, member participation, and reward distribution is designed to increase gem generation day by day, fostering a thriving, interconnected community. Our aim is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where engagement and rewards fuel each other, enhancing the overall experience for everyone involved.
