## Goals of This Release

- **Address Spam and Bots:** Implement effective solutions to eliminate spam and bots, ensuring a cleaner and safer platform for all users.
- **Unique User Experience:** Provide an unparalleled user experience by offering a combination of openness, rewarding engagement, fun interactions, and effective use of the platformâ€”features not concurrently available on any other SocialFi app.
- **Strengthen Host-Community Bonds:** Specifically focus on enhancing the bonding between hosts and their communities, fostering deeper and more meaningful relationships that underpin the platform's sense of unity and belonging.
- **Fair Reward Distribution:** Adjust the methodology for utilizing gems in the calculation of Blast gold distribution, aiming for a reward system that is fair and incentivizes meaningful participation within the community.

## Key Updates

### Rollout of Sentinel
We're proud to announce the rollout of Sentinel, a game-changing collaborative content quality control solution that empowers shareholders to protect our spaces and ensure quality interactions. Stake your gems for speaking rights and help safeguard the integrity of discussions within our community.
### Anti-Bots Human Verification
To further secure our platform, we've implemented additional human verification steps. These measures are critical for actions like buying shares, rally participation, and claiming ole airdrops, ensuring authenticity in every transaction.
## Reward Recalibration: Enhancing Fairness and Participation
In our latest review, we've adjusted our rewards system to uphold the integrity of our platform and honor genuine community engagement:
- **Account and Reward Adjustments**: Approximately 4,500 accounts have been banned and their rewards zeroed for violating our community standards through Sybil activities, spam, bot usage, and like farming. An additional tier of 500 accounts have experienced reductions in gem rewards proportionate to the level of their offenses.
- **Like Reward Scaling**: While likes still contribute to the rewards system, their impact has been significantly reduced. This change is in preparation for the complete removal of like rewards by epoch 2, steering our community towards more meaningful engagement metrics.
- **Prioritizing Active Contribution**: We are now assigning a higher value to gems earned by active hosts and shareholders. This adjustment is to reward those who are deeply engaged in the vibrancy and governance of our community.
- **Gold Redistribution**: DistrictOne is opting out of receiving Gold rewards, choosing instead to reallocate this

### Blast Gold Distribution
Access [Reward Page](https://districtone.io/reward) on D1 to claim your Blast Gold rewards. Get 10% more Gold if you share your achievement with invite on Twitter. These rewards are a testament to your active engagement, based on the total Gems you've earned.
### Rally Redesigned
We've reenvisioned rallies with an entry fee of 100 gems and a 400-gem contribution to the jackpot by each participant. Rally rewards now offer sOLE and shareholder boosts, potentially increasing rewards up to 6x. With rallies every two hours and a cap of three participation per day, we're balancing excitement with fair chances for all. More details in [Rally](../money-games/rally)
### Gems Gifts and Airdrops from Hosts
Community-building takes a new form with our innovative feature for hosts to gift Gems or initiate airdrops. Every day, hosts can distribute Gems as rewards to active community members as gifts or airdrops, based on the prior day's engagement metrics. This new system not only incentivizes daily interaction but also provides hosts with a direct way to acknowledge and reward their most engaged members, fostering a thriving and supportive community ecosystem.
### Boost Up for sOLE and Shareholders
The reward structure for sOLE and shareholders has been significantly enhanced. sOLE earnings have been escalated from 100% to 300%, tripling the potential rewards. Shareholder boosts have seen an increase from 200% to 300%, offering a substantial incentive for continued investment and engagement in community spaces. These boosts are designed to reward our most dedicated users and to encourage a deeper level of participation and contribution to the platform.
### Removal of Gems for Likes
While likes are a form of appreciation, they have become a medium for spam and like farming, detracting from content quality. This feature will be discontinued.
### Active Participation Requirement for Hosts
To claim daily gems from their spaces, hosts and cohosts must actively participate in the community.
