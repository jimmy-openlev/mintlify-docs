## Introduction
Blast Gold represents the commitment of the Blast team to empower dApps and their communities. As an integral part of the D1 ecosystem, Blast Gold is allocated by the Blast team and is dedicated to fueling the long-term growth of our platform.

## Earning Blast Gold
Blast Gold is received from the Blast team as part of their developer points distribution, designed to support the continual development of dApps within the ecosystem. DistrictOne is devoted to redistributing 100% of received Blast Gold to its users, rewarding them for their engagement and support.

## Redistribution of Blast Gold
The redistribution of Blast Gold within DistrictOne is based on the following principles:

- **Epoch-Based Distribution**: Blast Gold is primarily allocated based on the gems collected by users in each epoch. This aligns rewards with active community engagement and contribution.
- **Special Allocations**: In specific epochs, targeted distributions take place. For example, in epoch 1, 20% of the Blast Gold is earmarked for the first 1,000 early joiners and sOLE holders, acknowledging their foundational support.
- **Synced Schedule**: Following the Blast team's lead, DistrictOne redistributes Blast Gold every 2-3 weeks, coinciding with the receipt of points from the Blast team.

## Claiming Your Blast Gold
- **Claim in dApp**: Visit [D1 Reward Page](https://districtone.io/reward) to claim your Blast Gold, and it might take 24 hours to show up on [blast.io/airdrop] dashboard.
- **Social Sharing Bonus**: Share your Blast Gold achievement on Twitter with your invite code to receive an extra 10% Gold.
- **Sustainability in Redistribution**: Unclaimed Blast Gold isn't lost; it's recycled back into the community, available for redistribution in the upcoming epoch.

## Redistribution From Partners
- **sOLE Holders**: If you're holding sOLE, you're entitled to a 100% redistribution of Blast Gold, Points, and Thruster Credit, reinforcing the value of your stake in the D1 community.
