## Introduction

Gems serve as DistrictOne's mechanism to reward and encourage community engagement, designed to foster an active and participatory ecosystem within the platform.

## Earning Gems

Gems can be earned through various actions on the platform, each designed to enhance participation and contribute to the community's vibrancy:

- **Signup Bonus**: Upon joining DistrictOne via a Linkup invitation, new members receive their initial batch of Gems. This bonus is determined by several factors, including your influence on platform X, assets bridged through Blast, and activities on friend.tech. Additionally, posting on platform X rewards you with an extra 50% Gems.
- **Active Participation**: Engage in various space activities, such as liking content or rallying support, to earn Gems. Active participants also have the chance to receive Gems airdrops.
- **Locking sOLE**: By locking sOLE tokens, members can double their earnings from space engagement activities.
- **SpaceShare Holding**: SpaceShare holders are entitled to 10% of the Gems collected from space activities. Moreover, these shareholders enjoy a 200% boost in their engagement rewards.
- **Hosting**: Space hosts earn a daily Gem income, which amounts to 3% of their space's total Gem earnings.
- **Unvested $OLE**: Keeping your $OLE earnings unvested entitles you to a 5% Gem bonus every week.

## What's Your Gems For

Gems not only serve as a reward but also as a versatile tool within the ecosystem, offering several benefits:

- **Bi-weekly OLE Airdrops**: Convert Gems into $OLE tokens to capitalize on your social engagements within the platform.
- **Blast Gold Redistribution**: Every epoch, Gems are eligible for redistribution as Blast Gold (Blast Developer Points), with allocations based on the number of Gems earned and the sOLE balance of participants, distributed bi-weekly.
- **OLE D1 Airdrop**: The upcoming 50M $OLE Airdrop in 2024 will be allocated based on the total Gems accumulated and the sOLE balance held by participants.
- **Exclusive Access**: Gems can be used to unlock special upcoming features and privileges, enhancing your DistrictOne experience.
