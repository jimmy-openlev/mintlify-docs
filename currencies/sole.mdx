## Overview
**sOLE** symbolizes the commitment of users within the DistrictOne platform, providing locked OLE/ETH Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens with a productive role in our ecosystem.

## Mechanics
- **Zapping**: Once you pay ETH on [Zapping](at `https://districtone.io/sole`) page, half of the ETH will be swapped into OLE and form OLE/ETH LP in [Thruster](https://app.thruster.finance/?token1=0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004&token2=0x73c369F61c90f03eb0Dd172e95c90208A28dC5bc), and locks for 3 months.
- **Redemption**: After the lock-in tenure, you can convert your sOLE back to OLE/ETH LP via your wallet.

## Acquiring sOLE
- **Zap and Stake**: Zap ETH into sOLE via `https://districtone.io/sole`.
