## What is SpaceSprint?
SpaceSprint is a daily competition where spaces within the D1 platform vie for the top three positions based on their share price. The winners are spotlighted on the platform, gaining increased visibility and growth potential.

### How SpaceSprint Works
- **Daily Competitions**: Every day, spaces compete to reach the top three positions by the end of the sprint period, with the sprint resetting the following day.
- **Share Price Focus**: The competition is based on the share price of each space, reflecting the community's activity and investment.

### Winning Criteria
- **Top Positions**: The spaces with the top three highest share prices at the end of the sprint period are declared the winners.
- **Reward Allocation**: Winning spaces receive rewards, which may include increased visibility on the platform, a boost in $OLE distribution, or other incentives to encourage investment and activity.

Both space hosts and members can contribute to a space's success in SpaceSprint by engaging with the space and encouraging investment.
