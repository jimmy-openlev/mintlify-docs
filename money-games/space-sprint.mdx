## What is SpaceSprint?
SpaceSprint is a dynamic competition within the D1 platform that allows spaces to go live and compete based on their share price. The competition provides an opportunity for spaces to gain increased visibility and growth potential without the constraint of daily rankings.

### How SpaceSprint Works
- **Custom Start Time**: Every new space can now choose its own Sprint start time.
- **Activation Threshold**: Sprints go live once both the share price and its 30-minute TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) reach 500 $OLE.
- **Sprint Duration**: Sprints can last between 30-60 minutes.
- **Fair Trading Policy**: The Fair Trading Policy is in effect during the Sprint.
- **Gems Incentive**: The higher the listing share price, the more gems for hosts to give away to boost engagement.

### Gem Bonuses for Space Hosts
Spaces from Sprint now come with gem bonuses for you to give away to boost your engagement. The higher the listing price of your space, the more gems you can give away!
