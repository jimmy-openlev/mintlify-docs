## Collaborative Quality Control
Sentinel is a unique money game in DistrictOne designed to maintain quality interactions within spaces. Users stake gems for speaking rights, incentivizing positive contributions and deterring negative behavior.

## How Sentinel Works
- **Stake for Speech**: To participate in discussions, users must stake gems, determined by space hosts.
- **Host Controls**: Space hosts set the gem-staking requirements, tailoring the entry barrier to their space's needs. Minimal staking gems requirements apply.
- **Collaborative Reporting**:  Reporters, who are shareholders and gem stakers, can report inappropriate messages. Successful reports lead to the redistribution of the reported user's staked gems among reporters.
- **Reporting Threshold**: For a report to be considered successful, a minimum of three and a maximum of twenty reporters are required. Additionally, these reporters must represent at least 10% of the valid participants within the space to ensure that the reporting mechanism is representative of the community's sentiment.
- **Consequences of Being Reported**: Reported users lose their staked gems if the report is validated. They're banned from speaking but can still participate in non-verbal activities like rallying, trading shares, and liking.
- **Universal Staking**: A single gem stake allows speech across multiple spaces, simplifying the user experience.

## Benefits of Sentinel
- **Enhanced Space Quality**: By staking gems, users contribute to a respectful and engaging environment.
- **Rewarding Positive Contributions**: Successful reporters share the staked gems, encouraging vigilant community policing.
- **Fair and Flexible**: Hosts can set their staking requirements, customizing their space's participation criteria.

## Future Enhancements
The platform plans to reflect higher earnings in spaces with higher staking requirements, rewarding users for contributing to more regulated environments.

Sentinel introduces a balanced approach to community moderation, encouraging active and positive participation while providing a mechanism to deter and penalize negative behaviors. By integrating this game, DistrictOne aims to cultivate a safer, more engaging social platform.
