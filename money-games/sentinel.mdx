Upgraded Sentinel redefines collaborative quality control in DistrictOne, transforming it into an interactive betting game. This system not only incentivizes positive community engagement but also adds an exciting dimension to moderation.

## How Upgraded Sentinel Works

### Initiate Report Betting
- **First Reporter's Initiative**: The reporting process is triggered by a user willing to stake 40% of the required gems for the room, initiating the betting.

### Community Betting
- **Participation**: Shareholders with staked gems can bet on "Ban" or "No Ban" by staking 20% of the room's required gems.
- **Outcome**: Winners claim all the stakes. Losers forfeit their bets.

### Report Resolution
- **Permanent Ban**: If a report is validated, the accused is permanently banned, and their staked gems are distributed among the winners.
- **Acquittal**: If a report is unsuccessful, the accused retains their staked gems.

### Time-Sensitive Action
- **Duration**: The betting game lasts for 1 hour, ensuring a quick resolution.

### Quorum Dynamics
- **Minimum Quorum**: A minimum three or 10% participants is required to proceed with the result.
- **Maximum Quorum**: A maximum of 20% participants is required to proceed with the bet.
