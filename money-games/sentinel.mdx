Upgraded Sentinel revolutionizes collaborative quality control in DistrictOne by introducing an interactive betting game. This new system enhances community engagement and brings a dynamic approach to moderation.

## How Upgraded Sentinel Works

### Initiate Report Betting
- **First Reporter's Initiative**: The reporting process is initiated by a user who stakes 40% of the required gems for the room, thereby starting the betting phase.

### Community Betting
- **Participation**: Shareholders with staked gems may bet on "Ban" or "No Ban" by staking 20% of the required gems for the room.
- **Decisive Host/Co-Host Influence**: A bet by a host or co-host ends the betting immediately and decides the outcome in favor of their chosen side, regardless of the majority opinion.
- **Outcome**: Winners take all stakes. Those who bet incorrectly forfeit their gems.

### Report Resolution
- **Permanent Ban**: A validated report leads to a permanent ban for the accused, with their staked gems being redistributed among the winners. Hosts can unban manually.
- **Acquittal**: If a report is not validated, the accused retains their staked gems and joins the winners in sharing the stakes from those who bet incorrectly.

### Time-Sensitive Action
- **Duration**: The betting window is limited to 1 hour for rapid resolution.

### Quorum Dynamics
- **Minimum Quorum**: To validate a report, a minimum of three participants or 10% of the participants is required.
- **Maximum Quorum**: There is a cap at 20% of participation for betting to proceed.
