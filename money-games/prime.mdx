## What is Prime?
Prime is a competitive feature on the D1 platform with two main areas: 'Prime' for top performers and 'Survival' for those at risk. It promotes ongoing activity, community engagement, and rewards spaces based on their daily contributions and popularity.

## How Prime Works
- **Daily Evaluation**: Every space is checked daily at 00:00 UTC to encourage ongoing competition and fair reward sharing.
- **Two Sections**:
- **Prime**: Spaces in the top 50% for share price compete for more rewards and aim to stay out of the Survival section.
- **Survival**: The bottom three spaces, as voted by the community, are eliminated daily. Active engagement and unique contributions help spaces stay out of this danger zone.

## How to Participate
- **Voting**: Each sÃ˜LE holder has six votes per day: three to support spaces in Prime and three to vote on which should be eliminated in Survival. Each vote boosts your GEMS balance by 500, increasing your rewards and helping your chosen spaces.

## Winning and Elimination
- **Winning Spaces**: Votes are tallied up for spaces in Prime, and the ones with the most votes get a portion of the Gold Bag reward, based on their total votes.
- **Eliminated Spaces**: Spaces that are voted out stop all activities, and their GEMS distributions to hosts are halted. However, shares of the space can still be traded.
