## What is Prime?
Prime is a dual-section competition within the D1 platform where spaces participate either in 'Prime' or 'Survival' sections. This feature is built to encourage consistent activity, foster community engagement, and distribute rewards based on performance and involvement.

## How Prime Works
- Daily Evaluation: The activity of each space is evaluated daily at 00:00 UTC, ensuring dynamic competition and fair reward distribution.
- Dual Sections:
  - Prime: Spaces within the top 50% in terms of share price avoid the risk of falling into the Survival section and compete for a larger share of the gold reward pool.
  - Survival: Spaces face daily elimination challenges. Staying active, providing unique content and building bonding relationships with space members avoiding being in the bottom three, as voted by the community, is crucial for survival and progression back to Prime.
- Activity Measurement: Prime focuses on several metrics including the number of holders, rally users, events, and gems collected, reflecting the overall health and vibrancy of a space.
