## Rally Essentials
- **Increased Frequency**: With Rallies now igniting every two hours, members are invited to a day filled with potential and excitement.
- **Selective Participation**: Regular members are invited to participate in two Rallies daily, while sOLE holders have the privilege of participating up to four times, allowing for strategic choices on when and where to engage.

## Contribution and Support
- **Supporting Spaces**: Your Rally participation is a sign of support to the host of the space. With a 200 gem entry fee contributing directly to the space's gem pool, you're bolstering the host's ability to create and sustain a vibrant community.
- **Jackpot Investment**: For every gem you invest, the system generously adds 400 more to the jackpot, exponentially increasing the potential reward for all participants.

## The Rally Experience
- **Swift Sessions**: Each Rally spans a brief but intense 15 minutes, challenging participants to engage quickly and effectively.
- **Selective Reward System**: Post-Rally, a gem airdrop rewards 70% of participants, turning each session into a strategic play for rewards.

## Amplified Rewards
If you hold sOLE or are a shareholder, you stand to gain even more. Your collected OLE from the airdrop can receive up to a 6x boost, rewarding your dedication and investment in the community.

## Understanding Rally Rewards: An Example

**Join a Rally and see how your engagement could turn into substantial rewards. Here's an illustrative example:**
### Rally Jackpot Calculation

Let's say a Rally session has 10 participants, each contributing 200 gems:
- **Individual Contribution**: 200 gems
- **System Addition per Participant**: 400 gems
- **Total Participants**: 10

The total jackpot would be calculated as:

`(200 + 400) * 10 = 6000 gems`

### Distribution of Rewards
Out of 10 participants, 70% will receive an airdrop, meaning 7 winners. The average distribution will be:

`6000 gems / 7 winners ≈ 857 gems per winner`

### sOLE Holder/Shareholder Advantage
If you're a sOLE holder and shareholder, your reward could be significantly amplified by a 6x boost:

`857 gems (average reward) + (857 gems * 6) ≈ 6000 gems`

### Comparison of Winnings
- **Regular Winner**: Approximately 857 gems
- **sOLE Holder/Shareholder Winner**: Approximately 6000 gems

This example demonstrates the potential benefit of participating in Rallies as a sOLE holder and shareholder. Not only are you supporting the community, but you're also positioning yourself for a chance at a much larger reward.

## Rally Participation: A Strategic Choice
- **Intentional Support**: When you Rally, you're not just chasing rewards—you're making a conscious choice to uplift a space and its host, directly impacting their gem revenue and the vibrancy of their space.
- **Next-Day Generosity**: The gems you contribute today empower hosts to gift more gems tomorrow, enhancing the community’s overall engagement and solidarity.
- **Community Impact**: Your Rally choices have direct implications. As you enjoy the community and the competition, you're also fueling the space's growth and potential for exciting activities the following day.

By leveraging Rally events, space hosts can create an engaging and rewarding environment, while members can enjoy the camaraderie and chance to win. It's a win-win feature of the D1 platform that keeps the community lively and engaged.

## In Conclusion
The new Rally is more than a game; it's a community-driven event that rewards strategic engagement and investment. By participating, you're not only seizing a chance to win but also shaping the landscape of the platform. Your actions carry weight—choose your Rally space thoughtfully, support your preferred hosts, and be a part of the community’s growth and prosperity. Let's Rally with purpose!
