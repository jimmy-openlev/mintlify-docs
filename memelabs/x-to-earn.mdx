## How It Works
- **Create to Earn:** Users can earn rewards by creating high-quality memes and content that generate significant engagement by tagging the meme coin or mentioning the meme's official account. The more popular and widely shared the content, the higher the rewards. Users need to post the tweet back to the D1 X to Earn channel so it can be validated by the community. Users must stake a small portion of the meme coin for each post. If the post is invalidated by the community, the poster will lose the staked meme coins and invalid for the rewards.
- **Validate to Earn:** Users can stake a small portion of meme coins to enter a betting game to validate each post. The winners from the betting game will share the meme coins from the losers and share the meme coins distributed daily to all the winning validators. Users can validate as many posts as they like. More winnings in validation bets will result in bigger shares in validation rewards.
- **Engage to Earn:** Meme creators can submit a link to the meme's official X post every day to initiate the daily Engage to Earn event. Users then Retweet or Quote Tweet the submitted post to share the daily reward. The reward will be calculated and refreshed by the D1 backend, so simply RT/QT to participate!

## Benefits
- **Increased Engagement:** By offering rewards for users' generated content and engaging with the memes on X, it helps the memes community to be active and engaging.
- **Improved Meme Token Utility:** Users have a reason to hold and stake while helping grow the community.
- **Revenue Stream for Influencers:** Influencers can gain from their engagement with memes.
