## Eligibility
- **Whitelisted Users:** Only users who hold certain ERC20 tokens and are whitelisted can participate in the Meme Airdrop events. The whitelist is defined by the meme creator and currently supports ERC20 holders for Blast and Ethereum. It ensures that the most active and supportive members of the community are rewarded. A snapshot of the whitelist is generated when the meme is created.
- **D1 Users Only:** Users must join the D1 platform and use their connected wallet address to verify their ERC20 holdings and gain access to the airdrop.
- **Future Expansion:** The whitelist will soon cover more blockchains and expand to include NFT holders or core users of specific protocols.

## Claim Process
- **Reserving Airdrops:** Eligible users must reserve their airdrop during the fair launch process. This reservation is necessary to claim the free tokens and is available on a first-come, first-served basis due to the limited quota defined by the meme creator.
- **Invitation Only:** Reserving an airdrop requires an invitation code, which is activated only through participation in the social launch (buying the meme token with ETH). This ensures that only engaged community members can reserve and claim airdrops.
- **Claiming Airdrop:** Once users have reserved their airdrops, they can claim the airdrop if the launch is successful and start trading. Users who have not reserved their airdrops during the fair launch will not be able to claim free tokens. The reservation wonâ€™t expire.

## Benefits
- **Viral Spread:** Free-claimed memes that are invitation-only are likely to be shared more widely, increasing their visibility and impact across the platform and beyond.
- **Increased Engagement:** By offering free memes to whitelisted users, the Meme Airdrop feature encourages higher levels of interaction and participation within the D1 community.
- **Community Building:** Airdrop events help foster a sense of community and belonging among the most active and supportive members, strengthening the overall development of the meme coin.
