## How It Works
- **Exclusive Meme Rewards:** Meme shareholders receive daily bonuses from at least 5% of the meme’s total supply for a period defined by the meme creator. This reward system aligns the shareholders’ interests with the future success of the meme.
- **Share Trading:** Shares are open to trading when the social launch starts. The meme creator has a 1-minute exclusive time to buy shares before the community enters. Following this, the community participates in a fair trading process for 30 minutes, **gated by the launch participation**. After this period, shares are open for everyone to buy with any amount.

## Similarity to Space Shares
- **Price Mechanism:** Shares are priced on a linear bonding curve, balancing supply and demand.
- **Transaction Fees and Airdrops:** Shareholders receive a portion of share transaction fees and can claim OLE airdrops from the space.
- **Gems Generation:** Gems are passively generated for shareholders based on the activity within the space, linking to rally events and host gift giveaways.
