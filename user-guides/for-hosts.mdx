## Start Your Space
- **Create a Space**: Launching a space on D1 free but requires holding sOLE, and it remains inactive until it wins Daily Sprint. An inactive space doesn't enable live chat, gems collections, OLE emission, and BlastGold Distribution.
- **Win at Space Sprint**: Define your space's purpose and unique offerings to entice users to buy shares, aiming to place in the top three to make the space go live (active).
- **Set Bootstrap Event Time**: A Space Bootstrap event can be scheduled to boost your space with a gem airdrop. The gems airdropped will increase exponentially with the number of online users during the 30-minute session. the Space Bootstrap event only happens once after it's live.

## Revenue from Community Engagement
- **Earn from Interactions**: As a host, you'll earn 3% of all gems, $OLE, and Blast Gold allocated to your space, which accumulates through social interactions like likes, rally participation, gem lucky drops, and more.

## Promote Your Space
- **Space Sharing Link**: Utilize the space sharing link that includes a preview and your invite code. This not only draws attention to your space but also rewards you for linkups.

## Space Rally Engagement
- **Rally Planning**: Organize rallies to encourage community members to return to the space at specific times for interaction. Planning topics and collaborations for these sessions can enhance engagement.

## Leverage sOLE for Growth
- **sOLE Benefits**: Use sOLE to boost overall earnings, especially during Linkup campaigns when inviting a significant number of users to join your space and the platform.
