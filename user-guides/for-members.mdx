## What to do in D1
### Invite with Instant Reward
Inviting new members to our D1 community is not only about growing our network but also rewarding those who contribute to its expansion. When you invite friends or colleagues and they join D1, both you and the invitees are instantly recognized with a bonus. This instant reward serves as an early thank you for enhancing the platform's diversity and reach, ensuring a richer and more robust community.

### Rally in Spaces
Every space within D1 is unique, and participating in daily rallies can make your experience even more rewarding. Join the rally in your chosen space and engage in activities that could grant you gems through a lottery system. This element of chance adds excitement to your daily interactions and could potentially lead to a substantial gem windfall, which enhances your influence and capability within the community.

### Engage with Hosts
Building relationships with space hosts can unlock a treasure trove of opportunities. As you engage and interact within a space, hosts may reward your contributions and enthusiasm with gems, airdrops, or even special gifts. These tokens of appreciation are not only a nod to your involvement but also a means to further your journey and success in D1.

### Invest in Spaces
Your favorite spaces on D1 aren't just platforms for interaction but also avenues for investment. By purchasing a share of a space, you link your fortune to its success. Shareholders often receive a percentage of the total gems collected, and your investment empowers you to influence the space's direction and strategy, aligning with your vision for its future.

### Space Sprint
Space Sprint is a thrilling opportunity for those looking for an edge. By acquiring shares in emerging spaces, you stand a chance to earn big rewards if your selected space climbs the ranks and secures a position among the top three of the day. It's a strategic play that combines foresight with the fast-paced nature of space development.

### Boost Earnings with sOLE
Maximizing your rewards in D1 can be achieved by leveraging sOLE. By converting your ETH to sOLE, you're not just participating in the platform's economy; you're amplifying your earnings across all spaces. This boost is a potent way to increase your stake and reap greater rewards from the platform's growth and success.

### Participate in Prime
For those with an appetite for exclusivity, participating in Prime is a must. Prime events and opportunities are gateways to unique rewards and experiences within the D1 platform. As a prime participant, you gain access to special activities and engagements that are not available to the broader community, placing you at the forefront of D1's evolution.

### Reward Collection
After an epoch's end, it's time to harvest the fruits of your engagement. Reward collection is a crucial phase where you claim the gems and bonuses you've diligently earned. These rewards are the tangible benefits of your active participation and strategic moves within D1, and collecting them is both satisfying and fundamental to your ongoing involvement.

### Create a Space
Ascend from participant to pioneer by creating your own space in D1. This is where you can lead and nurture a part of the community that resonates with your interests and expertise. In crafting your space, you shape the experiences and offerings for others, fostering a segment of D1 that's truly your own, while inspiring others to engage and invest.

### Purchase OLE
Investing in OLE, the currency of D1, is investing in the platform's very foundation. By purchasing OLE, you secure a tangible asset within the digital economy and affirm your commitment to the platform's future. It's a strategic move that not only endorses the value of D1 but also entrenches your role as a stakeholder in its thriving ecosystem.
