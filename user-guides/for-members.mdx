## Being Active and Collect Rewards in Spaces
- **Daily Rallies**: You can rally once per day, joining in any of three rally sessions each day (4am, 12pm, 8pm UTC) to collect gems in your favorite space for a chance to win the jackpot. The more rally participants, the bigger the gems jackpot.
- **Join Bootstrap Sessions**: To bootstrap new spaces, you can earn more gems by participating in space bootstrap sessions; the rewards pool increases exponentially with more active members joining in.
- **Social Engagement**: Earn gems by giving and receiving likes within the community.

## Buying SpaceShare
- **Invest in Spaces**: If you are a loyal supporter or speculate on a space's performance, you can purchase space shares priced with a linear bonding curve to:
- Share up to 80% of share transaction fees, with 20% fee onchain distribution, and 60% with real-time lucky drops to the space once the transaction happened.
- Share $gems (convertible to $OLE) and Blast Gold if the space is active, more active, more emission to the space.
- 200% extra boosts to your gems collection in the space.

## Speculate and Support in Space Sprint
- **Space Sprint**: It is the best place to get into space share with a low price, as all new spaces need to win the daily sprint being top 3 with the highest share price.

## Boost Your Earnings with sOLE
- **sOLE = Staking OLE/ETH LP**: Use the zapper to convert ETH into 4.7 sOLE and lock for 3 months to boost your earnings.
- **"Lock Early"**: 4.7 sOLE worth about $50 at the launch, but the value will increase when OLE or ETH goes up.
- **Benefits of Holding sOLE**: 100% boost in gems earning in all spaces, being able to steal in linkup, eligible for reward compounding, eligible for blast developer airdrop (blast gold), eligible for OLE D1 season airdrop.

## How Do Your Gems Convert to OLE
- **Biweekly #OLE Airdrop**: D1 converts earned gems to $OLE via bi-weekly airdrop.
- **7 Days Linear Vesting**: You can opt to kick off one-week linear vesting after each airdrop.
- **Compounding Rewards**: Members are encouraged to keep their OLE earning unvested, so their $OLE gets 0.3% daily interest and 3% weekly extra gems and Blast Gold.
